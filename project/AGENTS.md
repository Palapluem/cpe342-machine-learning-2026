## Project brief

Read `docs/project-instruction.md` for background on each task: situation, example features, and hints. Each task has its own Kaggle competition page. If the two differ, the Kaggle page is correct.

| Task | Type                       | Target         | Metric   | Pre-trained models |
| ---- | -------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | Binary classification      | `is_cheater`   | F2       | Not allowed        |
| 2    | Multi-class classification | `segment`      | F1       | Not allowed        |
| 3    | Regression                 | `spending_30d` | NMAE     | Not allowed        |
| 4    | Image classification       | `game_title`   | Macro F1 | Allowed            |
| 5    | Anomaly detection          | `is_anomaly`   | F3       | Not allowed        |

## Repository layout

Each task is an independent uv project in its own folder.

```
docs/      project instruction
task1/     Task 1 uv project
task2/     Task 2 uv project
task3/     Task 3 uv project
task4/     Task 4 uv project
task5/     Task 5 uv project
```

Each task folder holds:

- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.python-version`: the task's dependencies and Python version. Commit all three.
- `.venv/`: the task's virtual environment. uv creates it.
- `.gitignore`: the task's ignore rules. Ignore `.venv/`. Do not ignore `data/`, `models/`, or `predictions/`.
- `data/`: the task's Kaggle files. Download them here and commit them.
- `models/`: saved model checkpoints. Commit them.
- `predictions/`: generated prediction files. Commit them.
- `assets/`: report figures and tables that notebooks and scripts generate. Commit this folder.

Rules for report assets:

- Save each figure from code into the task's `assets/` folder. The code that makes a figure stays in the task folder, so the team can make it again.
- Name each file in kebab-case by its content, for example `confusion-matrix.png` or `feature-importance.png`.
- Save PNG figures at 300 dpi with `bbox_inches="tight"`.
- Save report tables as CSV or Markdown.

Rules for task folders:

- Run every command from inside the task folder. Use `uv run <command>` so the command uses that task's `.venv`.
- Add packages with `uv add <package>` inside the task folder. Each task keeps its own dependency set.
- Keep each task self-contained. A task folder imports no code from another task folder.

## Competition rules

These rules are hard guardrails. A violation can disqualify the team.

- Use only the provided Kaggle datasets.
- Train on Train and Val combined.
- Use the Test set only to make predictions. Test rows never enter model fitting, pseudo-labeling, or fine-tuning.
- Task 5 is the exception: it has only `test.csv`, so the unsupervised model fits on it without labels.
- Train Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 5 from scratch. Use pre-trained weights only in Task 4.
- Use hyperparameter tuning tools such as Optuna or scikit-learn search. Never use AutoML frameworks: AutoGluon, auto-sklearn, H2O AutoML, FLAML, TPOT, PyCaret.
- Write all code inside the team. Share no code or predictions with other teams.

## Metric-driven choices

- Tasks 1 and 5 weight recall above precision (F2, F3). Tune each decision threshold on out-of-fold predictions to maximize that task's metric.
- Task 3 data is zero-inflated. If you train on a log target, invert the transform before you write predictions in THB.
- Use out-of-fold cross-validation scores to compare models. Use the public leaderboard as a second check only.

## Submission

Fill `sample_submission.csv` and keep its row order.

- Columns: `id`, `task1`, `task2`, `task3`, `task4`, `task5`.
- Rows: 25,889. Every cell has a value.
- `task1`, `task5`: `0` or `1`. `task2`: `0`–`3`. `task3`: THB amount. `task4`: one of `7-11K`, `fiveN`, `freefried`, `pube`, `roblock`.
